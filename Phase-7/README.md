# Project Practice (Node.js + PostgreSQL)

## Introduction

- The fundamentals of working with PostgreSQL (pg) in Node.js:
  1. Setting up connections
  2. Writing queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
  3. Handling errors and transactions
  4. Using connection pooling for efficiency
  5. Structuring code properly with reusable database modules

## Project Goal

- Build a simple Users + Tasks API using Node.js + PostgreSQL.

- This project will simulate a real-world backend system and help practice:
  1. **CRUD operations** → Create, Read, Update, Delete users and tasks.
  2. **Parameterized queries** → Protect against SQL injection.
  3. **Transactions** → Ensure consistency (e.g., auto-create a welcome task when a new user is added).
  4. **Pooling** → Use a connection pool for scalability.

## Why this project matters?

- It forces to combine everything learned.
- Mimics real-world API design (common interview/demo project).
- Teaches to balance code **organization + database operations**.
